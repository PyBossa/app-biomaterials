    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <img class="img-polaroid pull-right" src="http://i.imgur.com/oozn3FT.png">
    <p class="lead">As researchers, we are developing new materials for targeted drug delivery and tissue engineering.</p>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <p class="lead">We create materials comprised of proteins through genetic engineering and molecular biology.  While we use the structural elements found in <em>natural</em> proteins, we stitch them together in ways <em>not</em> found in nature thereby generating <em>new</em> protein materials.</p>
    <h1>How you can help</h1>
    <p class="lead">We need you to characterize these new materials.  For example, you might identify their size, shape and amount.</p>
    <h1>Will your help make a difference?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Absolutely! The size, shape and amount of the newly created materials that you have identified are essential. In short, you will help to cure cancers, treat osteoarthritis, and fabricate new tissues! </p>
